Simple program to generate pairs from a list of people. Useful to set up automatic pair programming sessions.

## Features
- Creates randomized pairs out of the provided list of names (names are shuffled)
- Stores history of used pairs so every run will create new pairs (if all pairs were already created, it starts again)
- If there is an even name, it gets listed separately
- Provides built-in integration to Slack
